## Usage Notes
### EHP Packer
Unpacks and repacks EHP archives. Load an EHP archive first with the "Load File" button. While an EHP archive is loaded, you either  
a) press the "Unpack" button to extract the contents of the EHP archive to a directory of your choice  
b) press the "Repack" button to choose a directory that you want to reinsert into the EHP archive

### StrTbl converter
Converts strTbl binary files into readable text files and vice versa.  
Make sure you don't change the number of lines in the resulting .txt file. In other words, do not remove or add any lines, not even empty ones.

### Story Rebuilder
When you launch the program, you get to choose which .txt file you want to reinsert into the story_scr_j_Old.ehp file.  
The resulting ehp file is generated in the "Algo Ehp" directory.  
Two story scripts have been included: the original japanese script provided to me by Omarrrio and the proper english translation script provided by me.
